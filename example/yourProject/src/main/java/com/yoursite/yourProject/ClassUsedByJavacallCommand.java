	 *                your plugin to pass the parameters to this method will

	 *                should be able to run the same plugin from the command
	 *                line.
	 * @return The method must return an integer value to conform to the Java
	 * API expectations.  Non-zero values trigger errors (much the same way
	 * that non-zero returns in other compiled languages often indicate errors)
